I worked at SparkFun during the summer after freshman year, where I got to design a few new products! I was working under SparkX, which is the company's experimental products division that works right under the founder, Nathan Seidle.

SparkFun's business model is built on breakout boards and libraries, which caters to folks like educators and hobbyists that expect products to work right out of the box. This requires an enormous QA effort, which is great for established products, but can stifle developing new ones that may or may not yet have a market. SparkX products let the company release a preliminary product to figure out how much it'd sell, without burning a ton of engineering time. If they sell well, then they'll get revised and enter the company's main product line. We called this 'going to reds' since SparkFun PCBs are red, but SparkX PCBs are matte black.

I created three new products for SparkX that summer:
- The _Qwiic Arcade_, which solders to the side of an arcade button, and reads the value out over I2C. These have an ATTiny84 that handles the I2C, but they've also got a FIFO so a connected device can poll it asynchronously. Unfortunately, this one didn't 'go to red', so once we ran out of stock we retired the product. But the product page is still on [SparkFun's site](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/15591). I designed and assembled the PCBs (by hand...it was a long summer) and wrote the firmware that ran on the buttons along with the Arduino library users would download.
- The _Qwiic Button_, which does basically the same thing as the Qwiic Arcade, but just with a tactile button. These did end up going to reds! You can now buy them with either a [red](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15932) or [green](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16842) switch, or even [with no switch at all](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15931).
- The _Qwiic Thermocouple Amplifier_, which uses a MCP9600 to read the value of a K-type thermocouple out over I2C. This also went to reds, and now you can buy it with either a [PCC connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16294) or with [screw terminals](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16295). I also wrote [the Arduino library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MCP9600_Arduino_Library) for this board.
